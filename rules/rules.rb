# Old version of the Ruby Discord's Server rules below
__END__
Ruby Discord Rules
We have some rules on the server. Please read over them and follow them, the rules are here for a reason!
0. Not knowing the rules isn't an excuse.
1. Be a decent human being. Don't spread negativity, shitpost, or be overly rude/insulting. (This also means no politics, as it always devolves and ends up hurting one person or another.) We're all here because we love Ruby, and we don't want to have a bad time.
2. No NSFW, racism, sexism, ageism, (any of the -isms really), hate speech, etc. You'll get kicked, and if the behaviour continues/is bad enough, banned.
3. Please, feel free to ask your question. You don't have to "ask to ask"; just jump right into your question!
(Learn more: https://dontasktoask.com/). However, do not solicit help from members in direct messages without their consent.
4. Please dm any @Admins with any concerns you have.
5. Please post topics in their appropriate channels: The channel names and descriptions are a good guide. After all, if you post something in the wrong place, people there won't know how to help.
6. No advertising other discord servers unless it makes sense in the conversation.
7. When pasting more than one line of code, PLEASE surround it with backticks (`‚Äîthe character on the ~ key) and mark it as ruby code:
```ruby
puts "Hello, world!"
puts "Yay ruby!"
```
Which produces:
puts "Hello, world!"
puts "Yay ruby!"

If your code's longer than ‚âà20-25 lines, please post a link to your code. Gist GitHub is a decent source, so is Pastebin.
8. Go to the ‚Å†roles-üë• channel to claim a role!
9. If you notice someone breaking rules, ping a @Admins.
10. Remember to drink lots of water! (edited)
